    <!-- What are <blockquote> and <q> tags  
        The <blockquote> and <q> tags serve to define quotations in HTML. While <blockquote> is used for longer, block-level quotes, <q> is used for shorter, inline quotes.
            
        They provide semantic meaning to your quotations, making it easier for search engines to understand the context and relevance of the content.
